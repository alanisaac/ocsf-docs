# OCSF Documentation
The ocsf-docs repository is intended to be the location where relevant proposals, documentation or other descriptive information for the schema are stored.
Documents such as Understanding OCSF.pdf are point in time snapshots of current work before public release.
Over time, documents will be organized based on version of schema.

Common questions are answered in the FAQs folder of this repo.  Schema specific questions are answered in FAQs/Schema FAQ.md

The governance repo holds the governance material.
